Implementation of FP-Growth and Apriori algorithms using weka library in Java Programming language, Data Mining second course assignment, Fall 2019
## Question 1
Using the Weka library, write a program in Java that loads the Supermarket data set and compares the execution times of FP-Growth and Apriori algorithms for the values of the following parameters by plotting the time.
- Supmin = [0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15]
- Confmin= 0.9
- Number of Rules = 100000
## Question 2
Using the Weka library, write a program in Java that loads the supermarket data set and first generates all the frequent patterns in a two-step process with the following parameter values using the FP-Growth algorithm, and then output all closed-patterns and all max-patterns in a txt file.
- Supmin = 0.1
